# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Severity-Classification

This repository is for my final project, "Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Classification from Retinal Fundus Images Using Multi Label Support Vector Machine".

My final project consists of 4 steps :
1. Image preprocessing: to enhance image quality
2. Lesions and blood vessel segmentation using CNN U-Net: to segment retinal lesions that indicate the severity.
3. Feature extraction: to extract some critical shape features that can determine disease severity
4. Classification: classify diabetic retinopathy severity based on extracted features
